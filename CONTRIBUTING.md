Hello there! 

Thank you for the checking out neuropredict, and for your interest in contributing. 

This is a relatively new project (less than an year old) with an exciting roadmap, both in scope and in long term goals. The core functions of neuropredict as a tool (learning, cross-validation and visualization) have been implemented already in their basic form. However, these could be improved significantly in various ways, which include:
 * **More Tests**
   * write tests for command line usage
   * write tests for input format support
   * write tests for integration among different modules
   * write unit tests or property tests to assert its advertised functionality
   * testing delivery/installation system to ensure it works as advertised on several platforms
 * **More documentation**
   * write examples for each type of usage
   * write more docs on results produced
   * improve docs on how to use the results
   * write docs on how not to use the results
 * **Portability**
   * Implement support for more input formats (besides CSVs, pyradigm, arff)
   * Propose and implement web-friendly output formats for results e.g.
     * json output compared to pickle files for numerical outputs
     * java script based visualizations instead of PDFs
     * interface to run neuropredict over web or on a browser (like a service)
 * **New features**
   * propose interesting and new use cases that neuropredict could support to further multiply its value
   * integrate Keras to offer support for CNNs and other variants
 * **Better software engineering**
   * building an API-like interface for programmatic access for advanced users
   * improving code base in terms of modularity
   * improving the executing speed by optimizing the code
   * improving the speed by offering GPU support 
   * ideas for GUI development
   * ideas for integration with other use cases
 * Any other features or idea that you think are interesting and helpful o you or your friends.


Thanks for your time and help.
