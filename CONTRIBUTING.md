Hello there! 

Thank you for the checking out neuropredict, and for your interest in contributing. 

As you may notice, this is a relatively new project with an exciting roadmap, both in scope and in long term goals. The core functions of neuropredict as a tool (learning, cross-validation and visualization) have been implemented already in their basic form. You could helpe improve and test them, and also contribute in the following areas:
 * identifying any bugs by focusing on the areas of neuropredict that you have expertise in 
    * write unit tests or property tests to assert its advertised functionality
 * propose interesting, popular and exciting use cases that neuropredict could support to further multiply its value
 * improving code base in terms of modularity
   * building an API-like interface for programmatic access, 
   * ideas for GUI development
   * ideas for integration with other use cases
 * installing and using it to ensure it works as advertised (and fix it otherwise)
 * sharpening or improving the focus of the repo in general
 
 
 *Under construction*
 
 
 To be improved and completed.
